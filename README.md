# Boolean-Satisfiability-Solver

HI Everyone,

Here is a Boolean Satifiability Solver also known as SAT Solver. 

The SAT Problem is described below:
The SAT Problem is one of the first problem that was proven to be NP-complete. 
It is the problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. In other words, it asks whether the variables of a given Boolean formula can be consistently replaced by the values TRUE or FALSE in such a way that the formula evaluates to TRUE. If this is the case, the formula is called satisfiable.
